# Neural-Style-Transfer-with-Various-Style-Representations
This project is written on Google Colab. 

We implemented three different style representation methods. 

The code can be accessed through [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11yc7rpJ9o1mthS3QUqSHeNBkwxVzjqzX/view?usp=sharing), [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cszsY7n78mJzaYehT9yeqkef7aUYXiN1/view?usp=sharing) and [HERE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S-d1sSUZ5bbaVL0jVf7XHJ4vjckwdGc3/view?usp=sharing).

This project reproduced the main contribution of two papers:
- [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)
- [Demystifying Neural Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01036)

We referred to [this tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html) in implementing the original NST algorithm proposed by [Gatys et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).
