This project is written on Google Colab. 

We implemented three different style representation methods. 

This project reproduced the main contribution of two papers:
- [A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)
- [Demystifying Neural Style Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01036)

We referred to [this tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html) in implementing the original NST algorithm proposed by [Gatys et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).

# Usage
To run the Colab files, you first need two images: a content image and a style image. You may use the images I have used in this project. You can find them in the file 'test_pictures' in this repository.

# Result

Below is the comparison of three different methods' results:
